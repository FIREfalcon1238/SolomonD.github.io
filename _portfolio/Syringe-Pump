## Features
* Precise Fluid Delivery: A syringe pump is a motor-driven device designed to deliver fluids with exceptional accuracy and a smooth, non-pulsatile flow. This precision is achieved through a lead screw mechanism connected to the syringe plunger, ensuring consistent fluid administration in medical and laboratory settings.
* Versatile and Adjustable: Syringe pumps accommodate a variety of syringe sizes and support variable flow rates, making them suitable for handling a wide range of fluids, including highly viscous substances. The pumps are also designed for quick syringe changes, promoting sterility and reducing the risk of cross-contamination.
* Critical Medical Applications: In healthcare, syringe pumps are widely used for the intravenous administration of fluids, medications, and nutrients to patients, maintaining safety and dosage integrity.
* Cost Efficiency for Broader Access: With most syringe pumps priced between $500 and $6,000, the development of affordable alternatives is vital. Low-cost syringe pumps can provide essential functionality in resource-limited settings and scenarios where high-end devices are not practical. This combination of precision, versatility, and cost-conscious design makes syringe pumps indispensable tools in both medical and scientific fields.

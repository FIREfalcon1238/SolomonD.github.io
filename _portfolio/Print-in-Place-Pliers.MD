# Introduction
This project showcases a print-in-place (PIP) 3D-printed pliers designed to function straight out of the printer with minimal post-processing. The defining feature is the built-in spring mechanism, which allows the pliers to snap open after closing. This innovative design leverages the flexibility of PLA while maintaining structural integrity for gripping tasks.

**What is Print-in-Place (PIP)?**
Print-in-place refers to 3D printing fully assembled objects without requiring additional assembly. This technique relies on precise clearances between moving parts, ensuring that hinges, gears, or in this case, a spring-loaded mechanism, work seamlessly post-print.

**Other Applications of Print-in-Place:**
* Hinged boxes – No need for separate lid attachment.
* Articulating figures – Toy snakes, dragons, and humanoid models with movable joints.
* Functional tools – Wrenches, pliers, and mechanical clamps.
* Mechanical chains – Ready-to-use chain links.

**Best Material Combinations for Print-in-Place**
* PLA: Great for detailed prints but limited flexibility.
* PETG: Slightly more flexible and durable.
* TPU: For truly flexible moving parts.
* Nylon: Excellent wear resistance for functional parts.

# Design & Iterative Process
**Spring Mechanism Design**
The V-shaped spring in the middle is the heart of the design, providing the necessary force to push the handles apart. This was achieved by:
* Using a thin cross-section in the spring arms to allow controlled flexing.
* Ensuring the material’s elasticity was sufficient to return to its original position.
* Keeping clearances tight but functional, ensuring smooth movement without fusing.​

**Iterative Improvements**
Early iterations suffered from overly rigid springs that failed to provide enough force. Adjustments included:
* Thinning the spring arms for better flex.
* Increasing clearance to prevent fusing.
* Tweaking jaw angles for improved grip strength.

**Pliers Specifications**
* Jaw Length: 22mm
* Jaw Capacity: 16mm
* Overall Length: 80mm
* Material Used: PLA
* Print Orientation: Flat on the bed

**Print Settings**
For best results, these print settings were used:
* Layer Height: 0.2mm
* Wall Count: 3
* Infill Density: 25%
* Material: PLA
* Bed Adhesion: Brim (to prevent warping)
* Support: None (designed to be self-supporting)
* Print Speed: 50mm/s​
